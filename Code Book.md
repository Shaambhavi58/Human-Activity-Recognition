## CodeBook: Human Activity Recognition Dataset

This codebook describes the variables in the dataset, the transformations applied to the data, and the steps taken to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis. The dataset is derived from accelerometer and gyroscope data collected from a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone to identify human activity.

The analysis includes extracting measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, applying descriptive activity labels, and cleaning the column names for clarity.
